# Community Real Agency Pack v1.0

The Community Real Agency Pack (in short, CRAP, yep, that's just how the universe rolls^^) is a KSP-community powered/driven collection of real world-entities all around the world.
It contains large logos for view in mission control, as well as downscaled ones for the vehicle assembly building.
Furthermore, it contains a neat selection of background info, in multiple languages, powered by wikipedia and the copypaste foundation, although no one is really sure where al that info gets displayed^^

In a few words:
CRAP is an agency framework, mostly intended for use with RealismOverhaul.

Furthermore:
The CRAP serves as well as reference for any modders, who make replicas, but aren't sure what exact manufacturer tag one should apply for having the parts in the proper manufacturer categories.
The CRAP heap of agencies is (hopefully) regularily updated, by... heaping up more... agencies :D , or whenever someone has the needs to add manufacturers, that our poor eyes had eluded before.

Requirements:
- None yet...
- Makes not much of sense if installed on a stock "Kerbalized" game, since only very few Kerbal-modders use actual manufacturers.

Installation:
- Standard procedures apply, first delete any old installments, if present.
- Copy the contents of "GameData" in the downloaded archive into your "KSP\Gamedata\..." folder, keeping subfolder structure. Voilá.

Support:
- For any manufacturer update requests or bug report, please don't hesitate to open an issue on GitHub (https://github.com/h0yer/CommunityRealAgencyPack) or post on the KSP-Forums ()
