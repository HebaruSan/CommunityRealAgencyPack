# Community Real Agency Pack v1.0  
_<p style="text-align: center;">for KSP v1.3.1</p>_  

---

The _Community Real Agency Pack_ (in short, _CRAP_, yep, that's just how the universe rolls^^) is a KSP-community powered/driven collection of real world-entities from all around the world.

It contains large logos for view in mission control, as well as downscaled ones for the vehicle assembly building's manufacturer tab.

To round it up, it contains a neat selection of background info, in multiple languages, powered by wikipedia and the copypaste foundation, although I'm not really sure where all that info gets displayed^^  
(Translation/localization WIP)

_In a few words:_  
_CRAP_ is an agency framework, mostly intended for use with RealismOverhaul.

_Furthermore:_  
The _CRAP_ serves as well as reference for any modders, who make replicas, but aren't sure what exact manufacturer tag one should apply for having the parts in the proper manufacturer categories.  
The _CRAP_ heap of agencies is (hopefully) regularily updated, by... heaping up more... agencies :D , or whenever someone has the needs to add manufacturers, that our poor eyes had eluded before.

__Requirements:__  
- None yet...

__Recommendations:__  
- Makes not much of sense if installed on a stock "Kerbalized" game, since only very few Kerbal-modders use actual manufacturers.  
- Install a fully fledged Realism overhaul suite :D

__Installation:__  
1. Standard procedures apply, first delete any old installments, if present.  
- Extract the contents of "GameData" from the downloaded archive into your ".../KSP/Gamedata/..." folder, keeping subfolder structure. Voilá.
