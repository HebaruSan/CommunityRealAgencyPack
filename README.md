# Community Real Agency Pack  
_<p style="text-align: center;">v1.0.1 for KSP v1.3.1</p>_  

---

The _Community Real Agency Pack_ (in short, _CRAP_^^) is a KSP-community powered/driven collection of real world-entities from all around the world.

It contains large 255x160 .png logos for view in mission control, as well as downscaled 64x40 ones for the vehicle assembly building's manufacturer tab.

To round it up, it contains a neat selection almost a of background info, in multiple languages, powered by wikipedia and the copypaste foundation, although I'm not really sure where all that info gets displayed, haven't see any of it pop up anywhere yet^^  
_(Translation/localization WIP)_

_In a few words:_  
_CRAP_ is an agency framework, mostly intended for use with RealismOverhaul.

_Furthermore:_  
The _CRAP_ serves as well as reference for any modders, who make replicas, but aren't sure what exact manufacturer tag one should apply for having the parts in the proper manufacturer categories.  
The _CRAP_ heap of agencies is (hopefully) regularily updated, by... heaping up more... agencies :D , or whenever someone has the needs to add manufacturers, that our poor eyes had eluded before.

__Requirements:__  
- _ModuleManager_, if you want to combine _CRAP_ with _DecalStickers_.
- _DecalStickers_ requires the _firespitter_ plugin, but it's bundled in the download.

__Compatibility/Integration:__  
- _CRAP_ Comes with module manager patches for blackheart612's "_DecalStickers_" mod and adds all the agency logos to the decal selection, while removing all original Kerbalized logos.

__Recommendations:__  
- Makes not much of sense if installed on a stock "Kerbalized" game, since only very few Kerbal-modders use actual manufacturers.  
- Install a fully fledged Realism overhaul suite :D
- I do recommend using blackheart621's _DecalStickers_-mod, you can stick 'em where you want :D  
- _CRAP_ contains a "mild" swastika, representing the Third Reich (Mittelwerk GmbH), if you are unhappy with that, simply delete "ThirdReich_logo.png" and "ThirdReich_logo_scaled.png" from the Agencies\ subfolder in _CRAP_.

__Installation:__  
1. Standard procedures apply, first delete any old installments, if present.  
2. Extract the contents of "GameData" from the downloaded archive into your ".../KSP/Gamedata/..." folder, keeping subfolder structure. Voilá.  
3. If you want _CRAP_ work nice with _DecalStickers_, download and install _ModuleManager_. (Link see below in support section, but I guess you have it installed already anyways^^)
